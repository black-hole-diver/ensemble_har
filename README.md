# 🏃‍♂️ Elite HAR: Pediatric Human Activity Recognition

An enterprise-grade, ultra-low-latency Machine Learning pipeline designed to classify complex, highly-variable pediatric physical activities using a single wrist-worn inertial measurement unit (IMU).

By combining raw physics extraction, aggressively regularized stacked ensembles, and real-time temporal smoothing, this engine achieves **99.24% live accuracy** with a microscopic **15.87 ms** average inference time.

## 🧠 System Architecture

The inference engine processes a continuous stream of sensor data through a three-stage pipeline:

1. **The Physics Engine:** Ingests a 2-second window (at 50Hz) of 9-axis sensor data (Accel, Gyro, Mag) and instantly extracts **72 mathematically proven features**, including signal magnitudes, Jerk derivatives, and Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT).
2. **The Elite Ensemble:** A threefold Stacking Classifier consisting of LightGBM, CatBoost (with L2 leaf regularization), and Random Forest. The meta-learner (Logistic Regression) votes on the physical signature.
3. **Temporal Smoothing:** A real-time `deque` buffer applies a sliding-window majority vote to eliminate single-frame physical anomalies and contextually correct the stream.

## 🔬 The Research & Experiment Log

This repository represents a rigorous evolution from a baseline model to an elite engine. Here is the record of our physical and mathematical discoveries:

### 1. The Inter-Subject Variance Crisis
Initial pure LightGBM models struggled heavily with specific classes (`<0.70` F1). We discovered that because children execute movements with massive biological variability (different heights, energy levels, and techniques), the sensor data was bleeding together. 

### 2. Mathematical Super-Classes (Cosine Similarity)
Instead of guessing, we bypassed the ML and used Cosine Similarity on the 72-feature centroids of each movement to mathematically prove what the sensor *could* and *could not* see.
* **The Crawling Merge:** The sensor physically cannot distinguish between `Bear`, `Crab`, `Spider`, and `Rabbit` crawls (similarity > `0.95`). They were merged into **`Crawling_Play`** (resulting in a 0.98 F1).
* **The Seated Triangle:** `Book`, `Building_blocks`, and `Peck` were identical small-motor wrist twitches. Merged into **`Table_Play`**.
* **The Footwear Re-merge:** Splitting shoe-tying by "same hand" vs. "opposite hand" caused accuracy to drop to 67%. Merging them back into a single **`Footwear`** class restored it to 82%.

### 3. Killing Variance (Optuna & SMOTE)
Learning curves proved the initial model was achieving 0.00 Training Loss (memorizing the specific children) but flatlining on Validation. 
* We implemented **SMOTE** to dynamically synthesize data for minority classes.
* We ran **Optuna Bayesian Optimization** with aggressive regularization, specifically clamping `max_depth` (3-7) and forcing high `min_child_samples` (50-150) to mathematically forbid the trees from memorizing individual subjects.
